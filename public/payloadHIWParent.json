Simply put, we work alongside your standard IVF therapy to provide detailed screening before embryonic transfer has been decided. Our tests are specifically searching for ANY inherited genetic mutations - these may be predicted due to the presence of certain genomes in parents OR the presence of unexpected mutations found in the embryo.",
